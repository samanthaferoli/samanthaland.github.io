     <p> Hi! I am Samantha and this is my blog where I will post life and funness and let my creativity FLOW! Im not sure what I am going to add to this as time goes on, but this is for fun for now! </p>
    <p> As of today, I have found myself becoming bored of who I am and the fact I have little to no hobbies. To fix this, at 1am I wrote on a bunch of sticky notes for the upcoming months,one being to code my own blog! For context I have never coded in my life and only recently have started due to my web design class this semester!!! SO FUN!</p>
    <p> Anyways, I am excited to see how much I can teach myself and how far this will go! I am hoping to turn some of my journal entries into blog posts or add something once a week about the week. Ill also start some column like things for my own personal thoughts on whatever has been on my mind! I am #soexcited to learn more about coding and more about myself! </p>
